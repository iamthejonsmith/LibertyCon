His debut novel, The Exiled Heir, was hailed as &ldquo;&hellip;a combination of pen strokes that successfully resurrect the old world fantasy concepts of Beowulf, Prydain, Oz and Masters of the Universe.&rdquo; His second book in his Autumn&rsquo;s Fall Saga, The Errantry of Bantam Flyn, launched in July 2014 on the Kindle bestseller lists at #6 in Norse\/Viking fantasy and #36 in Myths\/Legends. Born in Tennessee, Jonathan began reading comics at an early age. (Conan the Barbarian Annual #11 was his first.) His love of fiction, folklore and by-gone days was further fueled when his family relocated to the United Kingdom. At the age of nine, Jonathan found himself crawling over castle ramparts, visiting old churchyards and getting neck strain marveling at towering cathedrals. He returned to the U.S. as a teenager where he survived parochial school and a rebellious year in New York City (where he unknowingly met his future wife), before earning his degree from Brevard College in the captivating wilds of Western North Carolina. Like many fantasy novelists, he originally developed his magical setting of Autumn&rsquo;s Fall as a backdrop for the roleplaying games he ran for his friends. After submitting his creations to a once-mighty RPG company, he received an offer to purchase his intellectual property. Ultimately, he chose to keep his brainchildren close to home and began writing the Autumn&rsquo;s Fall novels in earnest.His greatest literary influences are Robert E. Howard and Lloyd Alexander.He currently lives and writes in Atlanta with his wife and toddling son, who can already throw a mean d10. His third book, a gritty sorcery and swords epic separate from Autumn&rsquo;s Fall, is scheduled to launch in Spring 2015. Other current projects include the third Autumn&rsquo;s Fall novel, a YA super-heroes series, and occasional freelance gigs for RPGs.

I&#039;ve been writing most of my long and wicked life, getting paid for it in the non-fiction category for something like twenty-five years, and writing fantasy and science fiction professionally since my first professional sale in 1992. (A story called &quot;Yearbride&quot; to Marion Zimmer Bradley for the *Snows of Darkover* anthology.) Since then, my work has appeared in such places as three volumes of the *Sword and Sorceress* antho series, *Turn The Other Chick*, Selina Rosen&#039;s *Bubbas of the Apocalypse* series, and numerous other anthologies and online venues. For the complete bibliography and what&#039;s in the pipeline, check out &quot;Teller of Tales&quot; on the HarpHaven website, http:\/\/www.Harphaven.net\/\nFor twelve years, I edited a size-issues activism magazine called *Rump Parliament*, which focused on working to change the way society treats fat people and served as a gathering point for people interested in learning and practicing effective activism against weight discrimination. A compilation of editorials and essays from those twelve years has just been released under the title *Prejudice By The Pound: Essays From The Size Rights Movement*.\nSize issues and SF&F came together in 2000 when I edited Meisha Merlin Publishing&#039;s first original anthology, *Such A Pretty Face: Tales of Power and Abundance*. Most recently, I edited an anthology of science fiction, fantasy, and related genre stories about the &quot;world&#039;s oldest profession&quot; titled *The Ladies of Trade Town*.\nI&#039;m a warrior by several definitions. Human and civil rights activist, accessibility activist, political activist, and someone not afraid to &quot;call &#039;em as I see &#039;em&quot;. More literally, I&#039;ve a fondness for sharp, pointy steel (I fence as a member of the SFWA Musketeers and the SCA) and firearms.\nAnd I&#039;m a Bard, Named - The Copper Bard - and sworn to traditional duties, some of which are acquitted in the above.\nI live in Texas with one husband of twenty-two years, and two cats.

            "bio": "US writer and academic who has made use of his field of scholarship (his PhD was in Byzantine history) to create all his best-known work, including several associational historical novels as by H N Turteltaub. The fantasy Videssos Cycle - The Misplaced Legion (1987), An Emperor for the Legion (1987), The Legion of Videssos (1987) and Swords of the Legion (1987), with the Krispos sequence, Krispos Rising (1991), Krispos of Videssos (1991) and Krispos the Emperor (1994), serving as a prequel - follows the exploits of a Roman legion translated to the empire of Videssos, situated in a world where Magic works and Byzantine history is recapitulated. The Basil Argyros stories (1985-1987), set in an Alternate History in which Mahomet became a Christian saint - assembled as Agent of Byzantium (coll of linked stories 1987) - follows the exploits of a medieval secret agent who tends to cause scientific innovations against both his brief and his intentions. Though these books focus on their various charismatic and canny protagonists, Turtledove&#039;s thorough understanding of his source material gracefully infiltrates the fun and fantastication.\nHe began writing work of genre interest with two Sword-and-Sorcery tales as by Eric G Iverson, Wereblood (1978) and its sequel Werenight (1979), which initiate the Gerin the Fox sequence of fantasies ending with Fox and Empire (1998) for details see Checklist; and was soon publishing sf and fantasy with some frequency, sometimes as by Eric G Iverson, some of his better non-series work being assembled as Kaleidoscope (coll 1990). Noninterference (fixup 1988) - in which a galactic survey team runs across Aliens - and Earthgrip (fixup 1991) - in which a reader of sf uses the expertise so gained to save alien races - are, unusually for Turtledove, straight sf books not set in alternate worlds, and were assembled with Kaleidoscope as 3 X T (omni 2004). A Different Flesh (fixup 1988) places hominid survivors (> Apes as Human) in an alternate USA, and A World of Difference (fixup 1989) confronts Soviet and US missions on an alternate Mars - here called Minerva - populated by warring Minervans. Certainly his most important singleton, and perhaps his finest sustained narrative, is The Guns of the South: A Novel of the Civil War (1992), in which the South wins through the aid of Afrikaners who Time Travel with advanced Technologies which are used to defeat the North. After the publication of this dramatic and sustained tale, Turtledove came into his own as the most famous and most prolific authors of Alternate History sequences; though some of the later series come dangerously close to repeating the techniques and motifs of earlier work, two long-running multi-section multi-volume narratives do stand out. Both are remarkable for their ingenuity, and for their almost unremitting (and sometimes savagely melodramatic) focus on War.\nThe Worldwar sequence is perhaps the more appealing of the two, in that much of the internecine intensity of Turtledove&#039;s treatment of purely planetary issues is here partially escaped. The first series within the overall sequence - Worldwar: In the Balance (1994), Worldwar: Tilting the Balance (1995), Worldwar: Upsetting the Balance (1996) and Worldwar: Striking the Balance (1996) - features a World War Two very similar to our own, until the Invasion of an Alien fleet (> Colonization of Other Worlds; {IMPERIALISM IN SF}) changes everything. Before an ultimate stalemate can be painfully achieved, Germany becomes an ally of America (with consequences close to those encountered in many Hitler Wins tales), nuclear conflict devastates the planet, and the aliens come to occupy most of the world beyond the realm of the beleaguered allies, dominant among them being America, Germany and Russia. The second series - the Worldwar: Colonization tales comprising Colonization: Book One: Second Contact (1999), Colonization: Down to Earth (2000) and Aftershocks (2001) - takes place in the 1960s, with the two races occupying the planet vying constantly for supremacy, a conflict in which advances in Technology tend to turn the tables fairly often. Homo sapiens, in line with a deep-rooted American Genre SF assumption, is much quicker-witted and adaptive than the alien foe, who are comfortingly obtuse and very clearly described in accordance with the traditional view that invading alien armies would necessarily be commanded by hidebound, reptile-thick bureaucrats - though in this series individual aliens do show an alarming ability to take on human characteristics, including a passion for Baseball. In the midst of all this, a continuing human campaign to develop a slower-than-light Starship points readers to the final volume of the overall sequence, Homeward Bound (1999), in which human forces arrive on the alien planet, Home, a threat to the balance of power that almost leads to a mutually destructive final war, though the arrival of a second human force in a Faster Than Light ship tips that balance in our favour.\nThe second multi-volume sequence, whose surtitle is Southern Vision, is much darker than Worldwar, depicting at great length the century after 1860 as subject to almost constant War, with extended episodes being couched in Military SF terms. The Jonbar Point for this Alternate History comes when the Union does not discover General Lee&#039;s plans to invade Maryland (the historical Special Order 191 did fall into Union hands, and arguably turned the course of the American Civil War), and the Confederacy wins, maintaining a racist hegemony over much of America during the course of the following war-torn decades (> Race in SF), not finally losing to the USA until the 1920s. In the meanwhile, on the larger scene, World War One begins, though much of Turtledove&#039;s attention is focused on the increasingly savage final conflict between the North and the South, which is recounted in terms of the same futile trench-warfare stalemate that marked the European conflict for years. After 1920, Canada, now an American colony under harsh control, suffers through the Governor-Generalship of General Custer. World War Two then breaks out, with the resurgent Confederacy attacking the North; during this war, Germany and other nations develop nuclear power: bombs duly destroy St Petersburg, Paris, London, and many other world cities. The world Turtledove creates in Southern Vision is significantly bleaker than our own.\nLater sf series, as indicated above, tend to repetition, though it may be that fantasy analogues - such as the Darkness sequence, beginning with Into the Darkness (1999) and ending with Out of the Darkness (2004), where a version of World War Two is fought in a universe where Magic exists - may have moments of genuine freshness; this may also be the case with the War Between the Cronies sequence, beginning with Sentry Peak (2000) and ending with Advance and Retreat (2004), where the Civil War is also fought in a world with magic. The Crosstime Traffic sequence of Young Adult tales set in a variety of Parallel Worlds, beginning with Gunpowder Empire (2003) and ending with The Valley-Westside War (2008), homages H Beam Piper&#039;s Paratime books and parallels Charles Stross&#039;s Merchant Princes sequence, which began in 2004. The Lost Continent of Atlantis sequence, beginning with Opening Atlantis (2007) and perhaps concluding with Liberating Atlantis (2009), is initiating by a very large-scale Jonbar Point: the calving off of the eastern seaboard of America, millions of years ago, into a separate continent which is discovered in 1492. A late sequence, the War That Came Early series beginning with Hitler&#039;s War (2009), may not prove to add much to Turtledove&#039;s several previous versions of World War Two.\nTurtledove has never failed to be exuberant when he sees the chance; and although it may be argued that he has not yet written any single book that has unduly stretched his very considerable intelligence, it may at the same time be suggested that the overall impact of his longer sequences is indeed considerable. Beneath the virtuoso sadism of his descriptions of conflict, and his sometimes morally unstable sweet-tooth for the depiction of Realpolitik in action, lies a sadness that perhaps befits our times, and an intermittent sense that we are better off in this world, that we know to be true, than in any realistic alternatives we might try to imagine. Turtledove won a 1994 Best Novella Hugo Award for &quot;Down in the Bottomlands&quot; (January 1993 Analog).

As far back as I can remember I&#039;ve always made art - it runs through my father&#039;s side of the family for at least the last several generations. I finally got serious about it in my mid\/late twenties, and spent four years at the Atlanta College of Art, concentrating on painting and printmaking on my way to becoming a sculptor. Go figure, huh?\nScience Fiction and Fantasy have been lifelong interests, along with mythology and medieval history, Egyptian, Celtic and Viking art, dinosaurs and the natural world in general. I&#039;m a sucker for word plays and puns - the more atrocious the better - and I&#039;m drawn to layered works, the kind that yield their secrets a few at a time, giving you something new each time you visit. I like Disney, Kay Nielsen, Edmund Dulac, Ivan Bilibin, Wyeth and Beardsley and Cicely Mary Barker, early Picasso and Winslow Homer, Deco and Nouveau - it&#039;s potentially an endless list, and somewhere or other they all probably figure into what I enjoy doing. \nIf there really are such things as previous lives, I think I might have been Japanese once, and\/or Irish. As the pictures will attest there&#039;s your basic Scandinavian pillager in there somewhere too and - just to muddy the waters - my surname is Latin for the Moor.Now that intrigues me - I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll ever find an answer, but it surely does intrigue me. \nI&#039;ve done beer stein, shot glass and goblet prototypes for M. Cornell Importers in St Paul; Scottish clan badges and kilt pins for Dunedin Scottish; medallions and event badges for the Whitewater Longhunters, a blackpowder re-enactment group in Alabama; prototypes for toy and doll manufacturers; guest presentation pieces for several Science Fiction conventions; and private jewelry commissions. I sculpted for Gallo Pewter for the better part of 20 years, had a short but brief tenure at TSR during their waning days (interesting place), and did pieces for SIAB for several years before settling in with 4C Collectibles. Along the way I&#039;ve done a little bit of book and magazine illustration, had a short-lived career writing columns for a local newspaper - I was sort of the token liberal, and a short story of mine was included in the NAMELESS PLACES anthology from Arkham House. Even masqueraded as an Irish folksinger for a while with a friend. We called ourselves Gilhooley and Schwartz. Chris was the talent there. On a good night I soared to the heights of mediocrity. But hey, we had a following. ",

            "bio": "I grew up with middle class parents in rural Oregon, with some of my earliest memories being Star Trek, the Apollo 17 launch, and reading classic science fiction.   As far as I know, I've always been interested in science and technology.  I thought that by the time I was an adult, there would be plenty of work for electrical engineers in space, and I liked circuits, so I studied engineering, and took vocational electronics training while in elementary and middle school.   That was when I realized that part of what was missing in the NASA\/Star Trek kind of space vision was - how was this going to get paid for?   I found the work of Gerard O'Neill that began looking for answers to that question.   It didn't seem necessary to me to work on space transportation then as the Shuttle promised to dramatically reduce spaceflight costs.\nAt Caltech, in the fall of 1985, I heard about the near-burn through on an O-ring of the Space Shuttle, and when, a few months later, Challenger was lost, I was shocked.   I'd sat in on lectures by Feynman, and when his reports from the Rogers commission came out, I began to realize that NASA's challenges were much deeper than just their level of funding.   I graduated in 1988 and went to work for Intel, initially doing chip design, then managing a group working on chip making technologies.  After a few years, I was part of a small group that recommended what technologies we would and wouldn't include in a chip making process, which taught me a lot about managing a technology portfolio so that billion dollar bets would pay off, in an environment where sticking with tried and true methods would lose to competitors.\nWhen the DC-X effort started, it really opened my eyes that perhaps the cost and schedule of NASA projects were artifacts of NASA and its structure and constraints, not necessarily of the physics involved.  I became one of the citizens talking to my Congressional representatives about the program.   That led to my attending the Space Access conference in 1994, and I realized then that if space made money, we'd do a lot more of it - and that I wanted to work on that field.   I joined AIAA and began teaching myself aerospace engineering in evenings and weekends.   In 1997 I was asked to join Rotary Rocket, managing their rocket development program.   While there, I put a team together that learned how to do liquid rocket engines from old NASA reports and papers.\nIn 1999, Rotary Rocket laid off me and my team as they ran low on money; I and three others then founded XCOR Aerospace, with a goal of developing reusable rocket vehicles that would fly frequently with a small crew, first for suborbital markets, with the goal of later scaling to orbital systems.  I was CEO and responsible for raising the money, managing the company, and leading the technical team.   That included eleven different long-life reusable rocket engine designs, and two demonstration vehicles based on aircraft - the EZ-Rocket and the X-Racer, which demonstrated over 66 flights a per flight cost of $900\/flight for a manned rocket, a ten-minute time to service a vehicle for re-flight, and 7 flights in one day.   I also worked with the United Launch Alliance on a commercial LOX\/LH2 engine project.\nFrom 1998 on, I've been involved in the U.S. regulatory regime for commercial space, starting with public comments on FAA regulations, then membership in COMSTAC.   I saw that further development was needed, and used the EZ-Rocket to set precedents which helped start the development of the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004, which codified a framework I had laid out for a human spaceflight regulatory regime.   That in turn led to a clear need for an industry trade association, and I was one of the co-founders of the PSF, later the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, and one if its directors for many years.   In part from that I know many of the senior figures at most of the leading U.S. commercial space companies.   In that framework, I was involved again in the SPACE act of 2015 and H.R. 2809 in 2017.\nIn 2009 I served on the Augustine committee, examining alternatives for U.S. human spaceflight strategy at NASA.  After that effort concluded, I continued to work with industry figures to develop policy alternatives.   I have come to understand that NASA offers the United States policy tools as part of our overall strategy in space which we are not fully exploiting.\nIn 2015, after shareholders brought a new CEO in to XCOR, I eventually departed.  Since then, I have served as CEO of Agile Aero, a company developing aerospace rapid prototyping technologies, and through which I have also offered consulting services to other space companies.   Starting in February 2016 I have also served as CTO of Electric Sky, where I have invented a number of new wireless power transfer technologies for unconventional space launch and other purposes.   And since July 2016 I have served as chairman of the Board of the Tau Zero Foundation, a non-profit developing advanced propulsion technologies with relevance to both advanced near-term missions and long-term potential for interstellar probes.   The Tau Zero Foundation is also laying out options to U.S. policy makers for very frequent, small payload, unconventional launch strategies to enable affordable space strategies such as boost-phase missile defense.\n",

The goal of TESS is to find targets for the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope which will look for signs of life in exoplanet atmospheres. Dr. Quintana worked at NASA Ames Research Center and the SETI Institute for many years on the Kepler and K2 space missions to search for Earth-size planets around distant stars. In 2014 she led a team of astronomers to confirm Kepler-186f, the first Earth-sized planet found to orbit within the habitable zone of another star. Her interest in space research began when she was a student at UC, San Diego, where she was advised by former astronaut and physics professor Dr. Sally Ride. She received a Ph.D. in physics in 2004 from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Dr. Quintana has participated in the discovery of hundreds of exoplanets using Kepler and K2 data, and her research focuses on studying planets in extreme environments (in multiple star systems, around red dwarfs) that were once only in the realm of science fiction.",

Writing has always been in her blood and she has often said, <i>&quot;There is no in the world more therapeutic than the art of the written word.&quot;<\/i> In 2009 Rebecca, with the help of a few close friends, opened an online publication called, <i>The Conzine<\/i>, a magazine that focused on who celebrities were behind the glitz and glamor of Hollywood. Since then Rebecca has had dozens of published articles on various online news organizations and also runs a fairly successful blog entitled, <i>Rose Are Red Violets Are Blue.<\/i> Rebecca began writing, <i>Midnight to Sunrise<\/i>, in August 2012 while attending a convention in New Jersey. She has always loved vampire romance stories but always felt they lacked originality because they followed the same themes. Rebecca was determined to create something that wasn&#39;t the typical vampire vs. werewolf story. She wanted to write a book that not only would she enjoy reading, but a book that might give people a new way to envision vampires. Since its debut on December 6, 2012 <i>Midnight To Sunrise<\/i>, has sold thousands of copies and has an ever growing fan base. Rebecca is currently working on publishing the sequel in the series entitled, <i>Darkness In Between<\/i>, due out later this summer.

            "bio": "US control-systems engineer specializing in aerospace propulsion and author, who began publishing sf with &quot;Duty, Honor, Planet&quot; for Analog, April 1979. His first novel, A Greater Infinity (fixup 1982), established the pattern he would follow through the 1980s: a complex Space-Opera adventure plot - assembling the variously published Greater Infinity stories beginning with &quot;Beer Run&quot; (July 1979 Analog) - involves humans from Parallel Worlds, one of them ours, with one or more Alien races as Wars, quests and challenges galore generate a sense of movement. The Makers series - Life PROBE (1983) and Procyon&#039;s Promise (1985) - and the Antares series - Antares Dawn (1986), Antares Passage (1987) and Antares Victory (2002) - are in this mould, but Thunderstrike! (1989) deals more mundanely with what happens when a comet strikes Earth, and The Clouds of Saturn (1991) concerns human and internecine strife in the cloud-cities colonizing Saturn (> Outer Planets). McCollum&#039;s touch is usually light, and accusations of racism - occasioned by the sorry fate Africa suffers in the Makers books - seem almost certainly misdirected. A late series, the Gibraltar Stars sequence beginning with Gibraltar Earth (1999) and built around First Contact tropes, continues in the same vein.

He blends comedy, tragedy, dark romance, popular culture, politics, religion, gaming, movie trivia, current events, and the occasional recipe with virtually every genre of music you can imagine.\nHis songs range from the slow and sensual (&quot;Starlight & Saxophone&quot;, &quot;Storm Dancing&quot;, &quot;Pluto&quot;) to the dark and dramatic (&quot;Hellraiser&quot;, &quot;PQR&quot;, &quot;Dervish&quot;) to the sweet and innocent (&quot;A Dragon&#039;s Lullaby&quot;, &quot;Take Your Hands Off The Bear&quot;, &quot;500 Hats&quot;) to the flat-out rockin&#039; (&quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot;, &quot;Rocket Ride&quot;, &quot;And They Say I&#039;ve Got Talent&quot;). He has written in dozens of musical styles, from Klezmer to opera to Zappa pastiche to gospel choir to hip-hop.\nBut mostly... it&#039;s about the puns. The grade-A, hi-test, godawful stinkbombs that make you choke on your own laughter. And the horrifically bad jokes that you can&#039;t help but giggle at. And the ludicrous yet somehow plausible situations that you have no idea where that came from. And the audacity with which he throws &#039;em around. &quot;Smurfin&#039; Safari&quot;, &quot;Five Years&quot;, &quot;I Want To Be Peter Lorre&quot;, &quot;Domino Death&quot;, &quot;Sheep Marketing Ploy (The Ballad of Fenton)&quot;, &quot;Divine Irregularity&quot;, &quot;Telly Taley Heart&quot;, &quot;Honey-Glazed Ham&quot;, &quot;House At Cthulhu Corner&quot;, &quot;Psychic Voicemail Hotline&quot;, &quot;Dead Potters&quot;, &quot;Badger Pajama&quot;, &quot;The Illuminati Polka&quot;, &quot;Talk Like A Pirate Day&quot;, &quot;Spoiler Alert&quot;, &quot;Undead Happy Trees&quot;, &quot;Lars Needs Women&quot;, &quot;Tech Support For Dad&quot;, &quot;Zombie Blues&quot;....\nAnd then there&#039;s the speed with which he does it. He can make up a ditty about virtually any subject on the spot. He has improvised entire concerts, and can&#039;t seem to let ten minutes on stage go by without making up something no one&#039;s ever heard before, including him.\nOn top of all that, he&#039;s carving out a bit of a niche market -- songs for web sites, especially online comic strips. He&#039;s written songs for Accidental Centaurs, Kevin and Kell, Something Positive, Girl Genius, and the online Furry Fandom magazine Anthro.\nSo far, Tom&#039;s got eighteen albums, fourteen Pegasus Awards for Excellence in Filk, an animated music video (&quot;Enterprising Man&quot; from the second Babylon Park video) and a spot in the Filk Hall of Fame.\n(From <a href=&#039;http:\/\/www.tomsmithonline.com&#039;>Mr. Smith&#039;s Official page<\/A>)",

His early work in both areas reflects his experience as a programmer for Xerox in the 1970s and 1980s. His stories have appeared in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, Omni, the Orbit and Nova anthology series, and several standalone print anthologies. Two of his short stories have appeared on the final Hugo Awards ballot. \nOn the nonfiction side, he has worked as a technical editor for Ziff-Davis Publishing and Borland International, launched and edited two print magazines for programmers, and has twenty technical books to his credit, including the bestselling Assembly Language Step By Step. He wrote the \"Structured Programming\" column in Dr. Dobb's Journal for four years, and published technical articles in many magazines. He co-founded and ran editorial for The Coriolis Group, which became Arizona's largest book publisher in 1998. \nAfter retiring from technical publishing, Jeff resumed his career as an indie SF author.  Most of his fiction involves strong AI. His first novel, The Cunning Blood, appeared in hardcover from ISFiC Press in 2005. All his subsequent titles are available through Kindle, in both ebook and print editions. Outside of writing and publishing, Jeff's interests include programming, electronics, amateur radio (callsign K7JPD), telescopes, history, psychology, and kites.

            "bio": "US writer and editor who worked as technical editor for Project Vanguard 1956-1958, and science writer for Avco Everett Research Laboratory 1960-1971, before being appointed editor of Analog following the death of John W Campbell Jr in 1971. The magazine had become creatively moribund - although it remained commercially healthy - during the last decade of so of Campbell&#039;s editorship. Bova maintained the magazine&#039;s orientation towards technophilic Hard SF but considerably broadened its horizons. In doing so he alienated some readers, who shared Campbell&#039;s puritanism - such stories as &quot;The Gold at the Starbow&#039;s End&quot; (March 1972 Analog) by Frederik Pohl and &quot;Hero&quot; (June 1972 Analog) by Joe W Haldeman, inoffensive though they might seem in the outside world, brought strong protests - but he revitalized the magazine, perhaps most notably with the 1972-1974 Haldeman sequence that began with &quot;Hero&quot; and became The Forever War (June 1972-January 1975 Analog; fixup 1974). In recognition of this, he received the Hugo for Best Editor every year 1973-1977; although he missed out in 1978 he gained it again in 1979 for his work during 1978, his final year as editor. Bova also involved the magazine&#039;s name in other activities, producing Analog Annual (anth 1976) - an original anthology intended as a thirteenth issue of the magazine - initiating a series of records and inaugurating a book-publishing programme. In 1978-1982 he was editor of Omni. From both journals he extracted several anthologies (see Checklist below). He served as president of the Science Fiction Writers of America 1990-1992.\nBova was active as a writer for many years before his stint at Analog, his first published sf being Young Adult novel, The Star Conquerors (1959), which began the Watchmen sequence also comprising Star Watchman (1964) and The Dueling Machine (May 1963 Analog with Myron R Lewis; exp 1969), the latter two assembled as Watchmen (omni 1994). He continued to concentrate on this market until THX 1138 * (1971), based on the George Lucas screenplay (> THX 1138). His next sequence, the Exiles series - Exiled from Earth (January-February 1971 Galaxy; 1971), Flight of Exiles (1972) and End of Exile (1975), all three being assembled as The Exiles Trilogy (omni 1980) - is also children&#039;s sf. Considerable work in shorter forms followed over the next decades, the best of it being assembled as Forward in Time (coll 1973), Viewpoint (coll 1977), Maxwell&#039;s Demons (coll 1979), Escape Plus (coll 1984), The Astral Mirror (coll 1985), partly nonfiction, Prometheans (coll 1986), Battle Station (coll 1987) and Twice Seven: Stories (coll 1998). Other early novels of interest include The Starcrossed (1975), a humorous example of Recursive SF whose protagonist is a thinly disguised Harlan Ellison (> The Starlost), The Multiple Man (1976), a suspense-thriller built on the concept of Clones, and Privateers (1985), which - along with its sequel, Empire Builders (1993) - succumbs to an assumption common to US hard sf: that governments will sooner or later fail to conquer space, and that individual entrepreneurs (vast multinational corporations exercising Japanese foresight [in the twenty-first century, Chinese foresight] need not apply) will take up the slack.\nBova&#039;s best-known stories, those about Chet Kinsman, an astronaut during the latter years of the twentieth century, were assimilated into the Kinsman Saga, whose internal ordering is Kinsman (fixup 1979) and Millennium (1976), the two volumes being assembled as The Kinsman Saga (omni 1987); Millennium, his best early novel (and perhaps his best altogether), is a tale of power-Politics in the face of impending nuclear Holocaust as the century ends. Colony (1978), set in a Lagrange-5 habitat in the same universe, carries the story - and humanity - further towards the stars, embodying the outward-looking stance Bova has held throughout his writing life, along with an ever-ready cynicism about government initiatives of any sort. More tellingly, the Voyagers sequence - Voyagers (1981), Voyagers II: The Alien Within (1982) and Voyagers III: Star Brothers (1990) - treats humanity&#039;s expansion within a framework of Space-Opera romance, with technology-dispensing Aliens establishing First Contact with emergent humans, star-crossed lovers, biochips and a great deal more. The Orion sequence - Orion (1984), Vengeance of Orion (1988), Orion in the Dying Time (1990), Orion and the Conqueror (1994) and Orion Among the Stars (May-August 1995 Analog; 1995) - puts into fantasy idiom a similar expansive message. Early novels and sequences like this, and the more recent Tales of the Grand Tour (see below), unfailingly advocate a private-enterprise based movement of humanity toward the stars; on this subject, Bova is consistently eloquent.\nThe more recent Triumph (1993), based on the somewhat precarious premise that Winston Churchill poisons Stalin in 1943 with a radioactive ceremonial sword, is an Alternate History tale which posits a more favourable outcome to World War Two. Technothrillers like Death Dream (1993) are stiff with earnest exposition of material not perhaps suitable for a thriller format or audience; Bova&#039;s most sustained and interesting work continues to focus on relatively Near Future scenarios of human frustration\/expansion into space. The best instalments in the loosely-structured Tales of the Grand Tour (for books included in this retroactive rubric, see Checklist below) are those, like Mars (1992) (> Mars), which describe with lovingly detailed verisimilitude various crunch points in the crusade outward; in this case, he focuses on the first manned flight to that planet. The series novel Titan (2006) won a John W Campbell Memorial Award. Tales of the Grand Tour (coll 2004) offers a guide to the sequence, which is described by Bova with sufficient flexibility to be associated even with the Kinsman Saga, a series so outpaced by history that it reads as though set in an alternate universe (> Alternate History). The straightforwardness of Bova&#039;s agenda for humanity may mark him as a figure from an earlier era; but the arguments he laces into sometimes overloaded storylines are arguments it is important, perhaps absolutely vital, to make.

            "bio": "S. M. Stirling was born in Metz, France, and traveled extensively with his family as a child, living in France and Kenya before returning to Canada as a teenager. He earned a law degree at Osgood Hall in Toronto, and worked numerous odd jobs before settling down to write full time in 1988. \nStirling is best known for his alternate histories, notably the four-book Draka series that began with Marching Through Georgia (1988). Conquistador (2003) is both an alternate-history and an alternate-world novel, and The Peshawar Lancers (2002) is an alternate history of arrested technology. His &quot;Island in the Sea of Time&quot; trilogy transported modern-day Nantucket back to the Bronze age, beginning with Island in the Sea of Time (1998). Change World novels Dies the Fire (2003) and The Protector&#039;s War are set in a modern world where technology has stopped working. \nA frequent collaborator, Stirling has written books with Holly Lisle, David Drake, Jerry Pournelle, Anne McCaffrey, Raymond E. Feist, and James Doohan. He&#039;s also written Babylon 5 and Terminator 2 media tie-ins, and edited Drakas! (2000), an anthology of work by other authors set in the Draka universe. Stirling lives with his wife in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n(From <a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.locusmag.com\/2006\/Issues\/01Stirling.html&quot;>Locus Online Interview<\/a>)",

            "bio": "US composer and writer, more active in and better known for her occult and mystery tales than for her early sf, which is mostly restricted to work from the 1970s; she has also written as Quinn Fawcett (with Bill Fawcett), Camille Gabor, Trystam Kith and Vanessa Pryor. After around 1980 she became (and has remained) identified with the Saint-Germain sequence of fantasies about a sympathetic immortal Vampire of aristocratic birth. Set in Europe and elsewhere over a span of centuries, the main sequence begins with Hotel Transylvania: A Novel of Forbidden Love (1978) and ends twenty-five volumes later (see Checklist) with An Embarrassment of Riches (2011); further volumes are expected. There are two subsidiary sequence, the Atta Olivia Clemens books about Saint-Germain&#039;s vampire lover beginning with A Flame in Byzantium (1987); and the Madelaine de Montalia books beginning with Out of the House of Life (1990). As these interlinked sequences have progressed, Yarbro has decreasingly concentrated upon the vampirism of her protagonists and spent much more energy establishing some historical verisimilitude for the territories visited, sticking more and more frequently to the end of the Roman Empire, where she has also set some nonfantastic historical novels. Other non-sf series include the Ogilvie, Tallant & Moon detective sequence with fantasy elements, beginning with Ogilvie, Tallant & Moon (1976; vt Bad Medicine 1990 as C Q Yarbro); and the Mycroft Holmes pastiches (> Sherlock Holmes; Steampunk) beginning with Against the Brotherhood: A Mycroft Holmes Novel (1997) with Bill Fawcett, writing together as Quinn Fawcett.\nIn other words, Yarbro soon moved a significant distance from sf - which she began publishing with &quot;The Posture of Prophecy&quot; for If in 1969 - and seems unlikely to return except casually, with the exception of a tale like Taji&#039;s Syndrome (1988), a Near Future medical thriller. Her most significant sf work, most of it decidedly more pessimistic about the world than her tales set in the past, include the tales assembled in Cautionary Tales (coll 1978), which share an energetic starkness, a tendency for her characters - as James Tiptree Jr remarked in her introduction to the book - to engage in rather arousing operatic duets and tirades, and a genuinely Dystopian vision of times to come; other tales of interest, though with decreasing sf content, were assembled in Signs & Portents (coll 1984) and Apprehensions and Other Delusions (coll 2004). Her first sf novel, Time of the Fourth Horseman (1976) - in which a plan to head off Overpopulation by reinfecting children with various diseases gets radically out of hand - confirmed this sense of the darkness of her work; as did False Dawn (in Strange Bedfellows, anth 1973, ed Thomas N Scortia; exp 1978), which is set further into the future and likewise deals with a world ravaged by mutated diseases. Nor did Hyacinths (1983), set in a Near-Future Dystopian America characterized by a wrecked economy and mind control, modify the sense that Yarbro was an author entirely in control of what she wished to say, and in what genre. Sf has been a genre which enabled her to look forward into the dark, on occasion. For the most part, she has gazed away from the darknesses she perceived in the times to come. She was honoured as a World Horror Grandmaster in 2003.

David began drawing and painting as a small child, influenced by comic books, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and a wide array of artists from Jim Steranko, to N.C. Wyeth, to Jackson Pollack. After high school, he attended the Colorado Institute of Art , Colorado State University and later transferred to Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. After school, he worked at Walt Disney Studios, ultimately becoming head of the matte department. He worked on &quot;The Black Hole&quot;, &quot;Tron&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, Stephen King&#039;s &quot;The Stand&quot; and most recently &quot;I, Robot&quot; for Weta Digital in New Zealand.\nWhile at Disney Studios, David began doing freelance art. His first published piece was the album cover for &quot;The Commodores Greatest Hits&quot;. His first sale of art for a book cover was for &quot;A Wizard in Bedlam,&quot; by Christopher Stasheff, published by DAW Books. In 1983 he moved to New York City, and a year later across the Hudson River to Hoboken, New Jersey.\nDavid has produced over 500 covers for most major publishers of science fiction and fantasy, including Baen, Bantam, DAW, Del Rey, Dell, Marvel, Omni, Playboy, Signet, and Tor. For Scholastic Inc, David painted 54 covers for K.A. Applegate&#039;s &quot;Animorphs&quot; series, along with the last 5 covers for the &quot;Everworld&quot; series.. He illustrated the popular &quot;Honor Harrington&quot; series for author David Weber. He painted the latest repackaging of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#039; &quot;Pellucidar&quot; books for Ballantine Books. He is a two time winner of Magazine and Booksellers &quot;Best Cover of the Year&quot; award, and winner of the Association of Science Fiction Artists &quot;Chesley&quot; award. Other clients include Michael Jackson, Lucasfilm, Universal Studios, Totco Oil, Galloob Toys, R\/Greenberg Associates, Click 3X and Spontaneous Combustion.\nAfter 20 years of traditional painting, David bought a computer ten years ago and has mainly worked digitally since then, preferring the powerful new tools that working digitally offers the artist. Most of his work today combines digital painting, and elements generated in 3D programs.\nDavid is married to Cathleen Cogswell, and they share their home with two cats, Jackson and Glinda (pictured above).\n(From <a href=&#039;http:\/\/www.davidmattingly.com\/Pages\/Davidbio.html&#039;>Mr. Mattingly&#039;s Official page<\/A>)",

Asprin&#039;s later novels continued to chafe against similar real-life constraints, and it was not until the invention of the Thieves&#039; World universe that he came into his own. The individual volumes in the sequence - a Shared-World fantasy enterprise crafted by a number of writers - were designed by Asprin to comprise a number of stories written (or edited) so that they read as Braids; he may have been the first sf or fantasy editor to create a significant braided anthology or novel. The sequence begins with Thieves&#039; World * (anth 1979) and ends with Stealer&#039;s Sky (anth 1989). Six Graphic-Novel versions of material from the sequence were published, all with Lynn Abbey and Tim Sale, beginning with Thieves&#039; World Graphics 1 (graph 1985), #2 (graph 1986) and #3 (graph 1986). Other fantasy sequences include the M.Y.T.H. sequence and the Elfquest sequence).\nSince 1979 almost all of Asprin&#039;s work was fantasy, mostly comic. An exception is his Phule&#039;s Company sequence - beginning with Phule&#039;s Company (1990) and ending with Phule&#039;s Company #5: No Phule Like an Old Phule (2003) with Peter J Heck - which deploys the eponymous passel of ragbag soldiers in a Space-Opera universe. A more recent series, Wartorn, begins with Wartorn: Resurrection (2005) with Eric Del Cario. Asprin&#039;s reputation lies mainly in the ingenuity of his braiding activities as editor, but his comic fiction was craftsmanlike.

Diagnosed with Dyslexia at the age of six, he spent the first years of his life learning in small a classroom away from his peers. He first learned to read on his own at the age of ten and was allowed to join his classmates in middle school. His struggles with reading left him without any ability to explore the world inside books like other readers. This gave him a drive to explore worlds in his mind. He loved to look at comic books and make up his own stories, which eventually led to him becoming a storyteller. Most of his life was spent as an artist, mostly a painter. For years he told his stories with a brush, unable to write his stories with the skill they required. As he got older, technology caught up with his disability. He was finally able to tell his stories and put them on paper with the help of speech to text software. This is when he wrote his first book, unpublished. After writing on several more projects, he published his first book, Luke Banderloft and the McFarven Pirates, book one of his current series. A story not unlike his own, but set in a world all his own. In 2013 he started production on a web series based on the Luke Banderloft series, lukebanderloft.com . Working with actors and crew local to Chattanooga and Trey Cook of Cook Box Productions, he hoped to create a film version of his book series that would show fantasy films can be done on a small budget.

            "bio": "Few can claim the varied background of award-winning author Stephanie Osborn, the Interstellar Woman of Mystery.\nVeteran of more than 20 years in the civilian space program, as well as various military space defense programs, she worked on numerous space shuttle flights and the International Space Station, and counts the training of astronauts on her resume. Her space experience also includes Spacelab and ISS operations, variable star astrophysics, Martian aeolian geophysics, radiation physics, and nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons effects.\nStephanie holds graduate and undergraduate degrees in four sciences: astronomy, physics, chemistry and mathematics, and she is \"fluent\" in several more, including geology and anatomy.\nIn addition she possesses a license of ministry, has been a duly sworn, certified police officer, and is a National Weather Service certified storm spotter.\nHer travels have taken her to the top of Pikes Peak, across the world's highest suspension bridge, down gold mines, in the footsteps of dinosaurs, through groves of giant Sequoias, and even to the volcanoes of the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest, where she was present for several phreatic eruptions of Mount St. Helens.\nNow retired from space work, Stephanie has trained her sights on writing. She has authored, co-authored, or contributed to some 40 books, including the celebrated science-fiction mystery, Burnout: The mystery of Space Shuttle STS-281. She is the co-author of the Cresperian Saga book series, and has written the critically acclaimed Displaced Detective Series, described as \"Sherlock Holmes meets The X-Files,\" and its pulp-bestselling prequel series, Gentleman Aegis, the very first book of which won a Silver Falchion award. She has dabbled in paranormal\/horror as well, releasing the ebook novella El Vengador, based on a true story. Her recent popular science book, Rock and Roll, a discussion of the New Madrid fault and its historic quakes, was a multiple-genre bestseller! It will soon be followed with Kiss Your Ash Goodbye, an explanation of the Yellowstone supervolcano. Currently she's launching into the unknown with the Division One series, her take on the urban legend of the people who show up at UFO sightings, alien abductions, etc. to make things...disappear.\nIn addition to her writing work, the Interstellar Woman of Mystery now happily \"pays it forward,\" teaching math and science through numerous media including radio, podcasting and public speaking, as well as working with SIGMA, the science-fiction think tank.\nThe Mystery continues.\n",
